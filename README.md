# Tornado Prediction System

## Overview
This project is an advanced tornado prediction system that analyzes radar imagery and predicts tornado likelihood using deep learning techniques.

## Components
- **Frontend**: A React application for user interaction.
- **Backend**: A Flask API that leverages TensorFlow for image processing.
- **TensorFlow Model**: A deep learning model for tornado signature detection.

## Features
- Image upload and prediction display.
- Detection of tornado-specific signatures.
- Error handling and loading states.
- Secure API endpoints.

## Deployment
- Frontend: Deployed on GitHub Pages or Netlify.
- Backend: Deployed on Heroku or any cloud service supporting Python.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the frontend and backend servers.

## Usage
1. Upload a radar image through the frontend.
2. The backend processes the image and returns a prediction.
3. The frontend displays the tornado likelihood and detected signatures.
